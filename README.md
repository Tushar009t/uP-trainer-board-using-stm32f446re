# uP-Trainer-with-STM32f446-microprocessor
EEE 416 Microprocessor and Embedded Systems Laboratory project, a trainer board having various functionalities for the lab experiments using Nucleo Board STM32F466RE 


The main purpose of this project is to implement a microprocessor trainer board using STM32F446RE micro-processor. 
STM32F446 is an Advanced RISC Machines(ARM) based microprocessor prepared by ST-Electronics mounted on the Nucleo-stm32f446re board. 
In this project, a goal was set to take advantage of all the peripherals and available customizable pins of the whole nucleo board. 
Compactness, smoothness and simplicity were the key factors for designing the whole project. 

Using Nucleo-64 STM32F446RE, goal of our project is to implement a compact trainer board which will host the following functionalities
1. LCD
2. 7 Segment Display  
3. 8x8 LED matrix
4. Generation of PWM signal - LED dimmer, RGB LED
5. ADC and DAC Port
6. Speaker
7. Stepper motor 
8. Servo motor
9. Sonar
10. Serial communication (I2C - With LCD, Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) -With 8x8 LED matrix, USART - With Bluetooth module)
11. Input device - Key pad, Push button (4)
